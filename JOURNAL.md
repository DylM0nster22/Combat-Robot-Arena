# Total Time Spent: 3hr

# June 30th: researched different prices and designes and started on a tenitive design

Today i started on the design for the arena with mdf or plywood at the bottom with a strong thin piece of wood on top, aluminium extrusions for the frame, and 24x48 1/4 in thick polycarbonate sheets for the walls. I created the frame and did some mods to the extrusions in the cad but i think im going to have to change them up more tommorow.

# July 1st: continued cadding ant idea making

Today i started the cadding process at about 8 am and continued working on it for the rest of the day, the bottom is made of plywood with a layer of hard board on top for added strength, the top of made of 1/2 in thick plywood thats cut in the middle so hinges can be added. I added corner brackets on every corner so the box would actually stay together and it helps support the bottom and top plywood. I also added Locking haspe and staple to secure the lid down when a fight is happening. The length that the bottom and top extrusions need to be cut to is 1209.20mm so trying to get as close to that as possible would be best. the vertical extrusions need to be cut in half so about 610 mm tall. i also added a backstop which is going to be made out of long 2x4.
