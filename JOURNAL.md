# Total Time Spent: 3hr

# June 30th: researched different prices and designes and started on a tenitive design

Today i started on the design for the arena with mdf or plywood at the bottom with a strong thin piece of wood on top, aluminium extrusions for the frame, and 24x48 1/4 in thick polycarbonate sheets for the walls. I created the frame and did some mods to the extrusions in the cad but i think im going to have to change them up more tommorow.
