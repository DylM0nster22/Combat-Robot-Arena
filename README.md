# Combat-Robot-Arena

I wanted to build this arena because i wanted to test out my robots with trial by fire, actual fighting and i though what other place to do it at other then at the undercity, so i asked if there was an arena and there wasnt, so i asked if i could build one and got approvel.

This is a combat robot arena that is sized for full combat antweight and below, it has 1/4 in thick polycarbonate walls so you can see the fights, it has 3/4 in thick plywood for the top and bottom, the top is split in half with hinges in the middle for each person to place their bots in, and it has 2x4 wood kickplates that are going to be screwed through the polycarbonate, the roof is going to be locked down by two or four hasp and staple latches.
